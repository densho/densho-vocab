The organization was decidedly patriotic and dealt with discrimination by emphasizing American citizenship, loyalty, and assimilation. Because of their ideology, JACL members were recruited by the military to assist in carrying out the \"evacuation\" orders, and they urged Japanese Americans to cooperate with the government. The group inspired strong, mixed feelings among Japanese Americans during this time. However, in the years following the war, the JACL regained much of its former support by successfully overturning many legal barriers for Japanese Americans.",

Most came to the United States as sojourners and planned to return to Japan after earning their fortunes. In addition, discriminatory laws forbade them from becoming American citizens and from exercising other basic rights, such as owning or leasing land. Since they were thus prevented from fully taking part in American life, it is not surprising that many still identified strongly with the culture of their homeland.",

When in Japan, the Kibei lived with grandparents or other relatives while their parents remained in the U.S. to work. Kibei often struggled to fit in both in Japan, where they were viewed as outsiders, and the U.S., where they were considered \"too Japanese\" by their Nisei peers. Because of their knowledge of both cultures and languages, the Kibei in particular were targeted by the government as \"disloyal\" during World War II. Ironically, the Kibei were heavily recruited for the Military Intelligence Service because of their linguistic abilities.",

American born, attending public schools, and influenced by American popular culture, they shared the same idols, favorite songs and sports heroes as most other children of their generation. Wanting to fit in, many Nisei with Japanese first names dropped them for Western ones that their non-Japanese friends could easily pronounce. Yet, most grew up in Japanese neighborhoods, and their parents taught them the customs and values of the old country.",

Commodore Perry had opened Japan to American commerce and trade relations in 1853, but anti-Asian sentiment resulted in the Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907, which halted the immigration of workers from Japan. In 1910, the Japanese population was about 80,000 in Hawaii and 72,000 on the continental United States. Japanese women continued to enter the country until the 1924 Immigration Act cut off immigration from Japan to the United States. Most of the early Japanese immigrants, the Issei (first generation), came as contract agricultural laborers, although many others were students and merchants. While Japanese immigrants were prohibited by discriminatory laws from becoming naturalized citizens of the United States, their American-born children (nisei) held U.S. citizenship.",

Many Japanese then emigrated to the mainland and worked for lumber companies, railroads, and canneries. In the early 1900s these immigrants began to establish families through the picture bride system (shashin-kekkon, literally \"photograph marriage\"). Immigrant bachelors sent photographs and information about themselves to go-betweens (baishakunin) who arranged meetings with the families in Japan. Marriage ceremonies took place in Japan (without bridegrooms), then the new brides traveled to the United States to join their husbands. Many arrived to discover that their husbands had misrepresented their appearances or situations.",

The majority of the immigrant workers came from the four prefectures of Hiroshima, Yamaguchi, Kumamoto, and Fukuoka. The country was hard hit by depression following the Russo-Japanese war, which ended in 1905. Hoping for better economic opportunity than was available in the rigid society of Japan -- then just emerging from the feudal era -- ambitious men, especially younger sons who would not inherit property, traveled to the new country with the dream of making their fortune. Pioneer Issei women -- the first Japanese women to receive public education under Meiji reforms -- joined them as brides, many seeking to avoid living under the authority of their marital families.",

The immigrants were examined and inoculated for communicable diseases upon boarding and examined again upon arrival.

Others sought to buy land, but the Issei had to overcome obstacles preventing them from competing with white farmers. California and other states passed alien land laws prohibiting Asian immigrants from purchasing or leasing agricultural land. There were ways around the discriminatory laws: an Issei father could put the property in the name of his American-born child, or issei could form corporations in which a majority of the shareholders were American citizens. Despite the alien land laws, Issei farmers played a significant role in West Coast agriculture. In the years just prior to World War II, Japanese American families grew 35 percent of the produce in California. By the 1920s, Japanese Americans supplied 75 percent of the produce and half the milk to the Puget Sound region.",

Wages were low -- about $1.50 per week in 1900 -- but room and board were provided, and living with an American family provided a means of quickly learning the English language and American customs. After the war, for want of better jobs, dispossessed older Issei and college-age Nisei (their American-born children) again took employment as domestics for well-to-do families.",

Issei (Japanese immigrant) entrepreneurs started the oyster industry from scratch in Puget Sound. Japanese American oyster farms became thriving businesses before World War II.",

These workers toiled under poor, unsanitary, and often dangerous conditions for low wages. Around the turn of the century, sugar-beet harvesters earned about $1.25 for a ten-hour day, railroad workers earned between $1.00 and $1.25 per day, and Alaskan cannery workers earned between $100 and $200 for a six-month season. They actively sought to better their wages and living conditions through organizing unions and engaging in strikes, despite being barred from white unions.",

Able-bodied men, both Issei and Nisei, were separated from their families and sent to work in forests and on railroads and highways. Families were subsequently banished to remote mining ghost towns, sent to work on sugar beet farms, or permitted to resettle east of the Cascade Mountains where the government severely restricted their movements. Land, buildings, and other properties were seized without compensation and without the owners' permission. Japanese Canadians were forbidden from returning to the West Coast until 1949, four years after the war ended. In September 1988, the Canadian government formally apologized for the mass removal and incarceration and awarded individual compensation to all survivors.",

Some 80 percent of the internees were Japanese Peruvians; the rest came from various Pacific-facing countries from Mexico to Chile. At the conclusion of the war, most of the interned Japanese Latin Americans were forced to leave the U.S. However, since many were initially barred from returning to their home countries, more than 900 Japanese Latin Americans were deported to war-devastated Japan. Over 350 Japanese Latin Americans remained in the U.S. and fought deportation in the courts. Eventually, about 100 managed to gain reentry to their home countries in Latin America. It was not until 1952 that those who stayed were allowed to begin the process of becoming U.S. permanent residents. Many later became U.S. citizens.",

However, this redress excluded Japanese Latin Americans who were forcibly deported from their home countries and placed in U.S. internment camps. A class action lawsuit, 'Mochizuki v. U.S.A,' was filed in 1996 on behalf of all the Japanese Latin Americans denied redress. It resulted in a settlement agreement authorizing an official apology and $5,000 compensation payments, one-fourth of what was awarded to Japanese Americans. Some Japanese Latin Americans decided to reject the Mochizuki settlement offer and continue litigation in U.S. and International courts.",

Still, hearings were conducted in 20 cities across the nation beginning in 1981, and in 1982 the CWRIC issued its report 'Personal Justice Denied.' It was an exhaustive work that combined the testimonies of former camp inmates given at the hearings and research conducted by a team led by Aiko Yoshinaga Herzig. Ultimately, the CWRIC recommended, among other things, $20,000 individual compensation to those incarcerated and a formal government apology. This recommendation would be the basis for the many redress bills that were to follow. *See the CWRIC collection under photos/documents for examples of the documents found by CWRIC researchers.",

The job of making the recommendations of the commission a reality, however, was daunting. Beyond the few sympathetic Japanese American congressmen and congresswomen, redress supporters had few Washington connections. In 1983, redress bills were introduced but went nowhere. Redress groups decided to shift their resources to lobbying. The strategy was to frame the issue in a consistent way with both conservatives and liberals. Others in the redress movement reached out to non-Japanese American organizations to widen the base of support. Years of hard work and dedication paid off in 1988 when President Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act into law.",

The Supreme Court had upheld their convictions on the basis of military necessity. In the early 1980s, researcher Aiko Yoshinaga Herzig and legal historian Peter Irons discovered declassified documents verifying that the government had withheld information showing that there was no military necessity in the forced removal and incarceration of Japanese Americans. Soon after, legal teams were assembled and identical coram nobis petitions were filed in three separate federal district courts on behalf of Hirabayashi, Korematsu, and Yasui. All three wartime convictions were subsequently vacated.",

On October 9, 1990, more than two years after the passage of the bill, the first of the redress payments were made in a formal ceremony to elderly issei survivors in Washington, D.C. Similar ceremonies were held in cities across the country. While few of those who were incarcerated feel that the government's apology erases what was done, many believe that a formal admission of wrongdoing helped resolve feelings of shame and corrected misperceptions held by the larger society.",

Despite serious problems with the wording and meaning of the questions, government officials and others generally considered those who answered \"no\" to these two questions to be \"disloyal\" to the United States, and they were transferred to the Tule Lake concentration camp which was designated a segregation camp. \"Yes\" answers to these questions made Japanese Americans eligible for service in the U.S. Army, and some became eligible for release and resettlement in areas outside of the West Coast exclusion zones.",

Most families lived in a 20-by-20-foot room separated from the next \"apartment\" by wood partitions that did not reach the ceiling. Shortages of food and deplorable sanitation were common. Overcrowding, uncertainty, and stress created tension in the \"assembly centers,\" even as the demoralized camp inmates tried to improve living conditions.",

            "description": "The War Relocation Authority (WRA) oversaw construction of ten concentration camps in sparsely populated and isolated areas. Between June and October 1942, Japanese Americans were transferred from the \"assembly centers\" to the larger camps. Housing approximately 120,000 people, the camps were designed to be self-contained communities, complete with hospitals, post offices, schools, warehouses, and residential areas. The WRA attempted to establish normalcy by setting up newspapers, a degree of self-government, sports leagues, and social events. But confinement, monotony, and harsh conditions exacerbated tensions between pro- and anti-camp administration residents and between the disempowered Issei and their U.S.-born Nisei children. At several centers, conflicts erupted into violence and at the Manzanar concentration camp the unrest resulted in fatal shootings. The WRA gradually granted work and school leave to those they considered \"loyal.\" The last camp closed in March 1946.",

The camps were organized in \"blocks\" consisting of twelve to fourteen barracks, a mess hall, communal showers and toilets, laundry facilities, and a recreation hall. Each barracks was divided into four or six rooms with each room housing one family, no matter how large, and there was no running water. The furnishings that Japanese Americans found on their arrival were canvas cots, a potbellied stove, and a single bare light bulb. The thin walls offered little protection from the harsh weather, which ranged from 110 degrees in the summer to 25 degrees below zero on winter nights. The flimsy construction allowed no privacy and made normal family life difficult. Camp inmates improved their own living conditions by creating interior walls and partitions, constructing furniture from scrap lumber, and planting gardens.",

Most were sent first to temporary Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) detention stations and then transferred to Department of Justice (DOJ) internment camps, where they waited to appear before the Alien Enemy Hearing Board. These hearings determined whether the Issei would remain in the internment camps or be \"released\" to the War Relocation Authority (WRA) concentration camps. After the hearings, most of the Issei were sent to U.S. Army internment camps. The U.S. Army, charged with detaining military prisoners of war (POWs), then returned the Issei internees to DOJ control. The DOJ camps also interned Italian and German nationals and Japanese Latin Americans. Most of the DOJ internment camps held only men who had been separated from their families, but three camps housed single women and families. The camps were run by the INS, part of the Department of Justice.",

The cost was especially high for the issei (first-generation immigrants), who had worked most of their lives to establish financial security for themselves and their children. Many Japanese Americans bitterly recall being forced to sell property, personal belongings, and business equipment for a fraction of their value to opportunistic scavengers. Evacuees could take only what they could carry. They left behind heirlooms, cherished toys, and family pets. Farmers continued to work for a harvest they would never see, told it would be \"disloyal\" to stop. The bustling Nihonmachis (Japantowns) of the West Coast closed down and never fully recovered, even after the war ended.",

Harassment was common -- many returning Japanese Americans were greeted with signs reading \"No Japs Allowed.\" Other discovered their property had been vandalized or stolen. Homes and businesses that had been boarded up or left in the care of others were abandoned and stripped of furnishings and goods. For the majority, who did not have homes to return to, housing was the most serious problem. Housing discrimination was severe in many areas and persisted to varying degrees until the civil rights legislation of the 1960s. Former camp inmates with no other options moved into hostels and converted community institutions with conditions not much better than the camps they had just left. Although this period was stressful, it is remembered as a time when people came together to share what they had.",

The early student resettlement to colleges in Midwestern and eastern states was organized by a coalition of church leaders and educators led by the American Friends Service Committee. The coalition persuaded colleges and universities in the country's interior to accept Japanese American students. It also helped the Nisei obtain security clearance to leave camp (a complicated process) and find housing. Tuition costs were borne by the students and their families. Although many parents gave up what savings they had, nearly all the students still worked round the clock to support themselves and their studies. By the end of the war, 4,000 Nisei students had entered approximately 600 colleges.",

People rushed to sell or store, in one week, property and belongings acquired over a lifetime. Some families tucked their valuables away in their attic or basement and locked the door, hoping to return soon. On the appointed \"evacuation\" day, thousands of Japanese Americans gathered at designated locations, with the numbered identification tags they had been issued tied to their coats. Watched by curious onlookers, they were met by armed soldiers and transported in buses, private cars, and trains to sixteen temporary \"assembly centers\" in California, Washington, Oregon and Arizona.",

While it did not name people of Japanese ancestry specifically, it was clearly aimed at them and was enforced accordingly. Under the authority of Executive Order 9066, General John DeWitt defined 108 exclusion areas throughout the West Coast, each containing approximately 1,000 Japanese Americans. The first exclusion orders were issued for Bainbridge Island, Washington on March 24, 1942. Orders were posted around town, informing all Japanese American residents of the impending mass removal. Individuals and families were given only one week to prepare. By the end of October 1942, all 108 exclusion orders had been issued, forcing over 110,000 Japanese Americans into concentration camps around the country.",

This was the first official notice Japanese Americans had of their immediate removal from the West Coast. The notices stated that they had six or seven days to prepare, and were to take only what they could carry. They were not told where they would be taken. People rushed to sell or store, in one week, property and belongings acquired over a lifetime. Some families tucked their valuables away in their attic or basement and locked the door, hoping to return soon.",

On June 5, 1942, 1,432 men left Hawaii for training at Camp McCoy, Wisconsin, and later at Camp Shelby, Mississippi. The 100th shipped out to North Africa on August 23, 1943, and saw heavy action in Italy. Because of its heavy casualties and many honors, the 100th became known as the \"Purple Heart Battalion.\" The 442nd Regimental Combat Team was initially formed in 1943 from Japanese American volunteers from Hawaii and the mainland. Perhaps not surprisingly, only about 1,250 Japanese Americans volunteered from the concentration camps. In Hawaii, where there was no mass removal, almost 10,000 volunteered. The 442nd arrived in Italy in June 1944 where the battle-tested 100th Infantry Battalion became its 1st Battalion. In seven major campaigns, the 442nd became the most decorated unit for its size and length of service; the unit suffered 9,476 casualties, more than 300 percent of its original strength.",

The MISLS was charged with training soldiers in the Japanese language for intelligence purposes. Japanese Americans served as both instructors and students at the school, which opened on November 1, 1941. The Language School began recruiting instructors and later students directly from concentration camps as early as July 1942. MISLS graduates were assigned in small teams to units fighting in the Pacific and to intelligence centers throughout the Allied command. They translated captured documents, interrogated prisoners of war, wrote propaganda, encouraged Japanese soldiers and civilians to surrender, and monitored radio broadcasts. After the war, they acted as interpreters at the war crime trials and for the occupation government in Japan.",

Nisei CIC personnel were assigned to every prefecture in Japan and relied on a network of police, local government officials and media to carry out their intelligence work.

However, state government officials and residents of neighboring states reacted with outrage that Japanese Americans were being encouraged to move there. Most Japanese Americans feared moving into such hostile territory where they would know no one. Further, few Japanese Americans had the resources to move their families to a new place. In total, 4,889 Japanese Americans left the West Coast \"voluntarily\" and moved to the interior of the U.S. during that period.",

Many Issei (first generation) had been receiving news from their families in Japan and were aware of the growing tension between the two countries, but few thought that Japan would provoke the United States into war. Japanese Americans would again be shocked when immediately following the bombing, the FBI began going door to door making arrests. Any issei who was at all prominent was considered a potential spy, including Japanese association officers, language-school principals, and Buddhist priests. Without any meaningful due process, these men -- mostly heads of families -- were summarily separated from their wives and children and incarcerated.",

FBI agents raided Japanese American homes, confiscating short wave radios, cameras, and books. With the systematic removal of Issei (first-generation) leaders, the Nisei -- children and teenagers for the most part -- were abruptly asked to represent the larger group as well as their own families. They found themselves translating FBI and military orders for their parents and helping to keep family businesses going.",

The pardon removed the criminal convictions from the resisters' records. However, other Japanese Americans, including some U.S. Army veterans and leaders of the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL), continued to label resisters as disloyal, unpatriotic, cowardly \"draft dodgers.\" Some Japanese Americans blamed the resisters for increasing the public's negative attitudes toward people of Japanese ancestry. These consequences affected many resisters for the rest of their lives. Despite an official JACL apology to the resisters in 2000, many Japanese American veterans' groups and others continue to harbor negative feelings toward the resisters. Legacies of the World War II ostracism of resisters contribute to ongoing division within Japanese American communities.",

At Heart Mountain concentration camp, Wyoming, resistance took the form of an organized movement calling itself the Fair Play Committee. Members demanded that their rights as citizens be restored before enlisting in the military. Eventually, sixty-three men from Heart Mountain refused induction and were sentenced to prison terms for draft evasion. In the other camps, disparate individuals made the decision to resist the draft. After being unfairly incarcerated for almost two years, they saw the draft as the final injustice. Ultimately, 267 men from all the concentration camps were convicted of evading the draft and most served time in prison. President Truman pardoned all of the resisters in 1947.",

Some Issei considered repatriation preferable to remaining in a country that had long discriminated against them. For Nisei, who had rarely been to Japan, expatriation meant renouncing their U.S. citizenship. Some were pressured to do so by family members or extremists; others were bitter about their mistreatment by the government. In total, only 4,724 ended up leaving for Japan directly from the camps and many eventually returned to the U.S. Nearly all Nisei who wanted to were able to regain their citizenship, although the process was long and difficult.",

Together, these resisters and their court cases tested two distinct yet intertwined constitutional issues: the legality of military orders on civilians (curfew, in particular), especially as they were selectively applied on the basis of race, and the legality of exclusion, again selectively applied on the basis of race. In all three cases the litigants lost at the trial court level and appealed to the Supreme Court. The Court ultimately upheld the three men's convictions and ruled that curfew orders and exclusion were constitutional.",

Korematsu decided to resist the mass removal orders, and planned to leave the state. On May 30, 1942, Korematsu was arrested for violating the exclusion order after failing to report to Tanforan Assembly Center. When Korematsu was contacted by an ACLU lawyer looking for a test case, he decided to fight the evacuation order. Korematsu lost his Supreme Court case in 1944. In the early 1980s, his case was reopened after the discovery of a crucial document indicating that in the original 1944 case, the federal government had lied to the high court. The conviction was vacated by U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel in 1983.",

He handed the FBI agent a four-page statement that explained why he refused to register. Hirabayashi was raised as a Quaker and trained as a pacifist, and his reasons for refusal stemmed from his religious convictions and pacifism. Hirabayashi was arrested and his case became an important test of the constitutionality of exclusion. In 1986, Hirabayashi's case was reopened and his convictions surrounding the incarceration were vacated by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing in part that, \"racial bias was the cornerstone of the internment orders.\"",
